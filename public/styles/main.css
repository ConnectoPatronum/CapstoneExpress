Color Style


"Incorporating a vibrant color scheme can breathe life into your design. 
The current palette—featuring hues like #3AA6B9, #FFD0D0, #FF9EAA, and #C1ECE4—sets a lively tone. 
However, feel free to explore additional adjustments to refine and personalize the visual experience. 
Whether it's tweaking the intensity, experimenting with complementary shades, or introducing subtle variations, there's ample room for creative customization. 
Your color choices can greatly influence the overall aesthetic, so don't hesitate to make further refinements until it perfectly aligns with your vision."
